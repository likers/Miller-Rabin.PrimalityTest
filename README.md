# Miller-Rabin.PrimalityTest

##Synopsis
This is a Python code which implemented Miller-Rabin primality test. Fast and powerful to handle large numbers. (confident for 19-bits integer or less)

Algorithm is based on Miller-Rabin's wiki page, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerâ€“Rabin_primality_test Pomerance, Selfridge and Wagstaff and Jaeschke have verified that it is no need to test all base number "a". Thus I set different testbenches (2,3,5,7,etc.) according to number scale in order to increase efficiency. So far the code support up to 19-bits integer and might need more tests for larger numbers.

##Tests
Run the code under Python 3.4 or higher
